===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

  document if you did not change the features you are implementing.

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.

    Point
    Pumpkin
    Scores
    SinglePlot
    Square
    Strawberry

- Revisit your proposal document. What components of your plan did you end up
  keeping? What did you have to change? Why?


- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?


- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?



========================
=: External Resources :=
========================

- Cite any external resources (libraries, images, tutorials, etc.) that you may
  have used while implementing your game.
