===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
  is an approprate use of the concept. You may copy and paste from your proposal
  document if you did not change the features you are implementing.

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.


- Revisit your proposal document. What components of your plan did you end up
  keeping? What did you have to change? Why?


- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?


- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?



========================
=: External Resources :=
========================

- Cite any external resources (libraries, images, tutorials, etc.) that you may
  have used while implementing your game.
