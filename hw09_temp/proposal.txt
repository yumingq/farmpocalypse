===============
=: Your Game :=
===============

- What game are you planning to implement? If it is a game of your own design,
  or not especially well-known, provide a 2-3 sentence description of the game.


- What classes and interfaces do you plan to create? How will the different
  components of your game (the model, the GUI, etc.) interact?


- What do you think will be the most challenging thing to implement?


====================
=: Core Concept 1 :=
====================

Concept 1: ___(fill in the blank)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?


- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.


====================
=: Core Concept 2 :=
====================

Concept 2: ___(fill in the blank)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?


- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.


====================
=: Core Concept 3 :=
====================

Concept 3: ___(fill in the blank)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?


- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.


====================
=: Core Concept 4 :=
====================

Concept 4: ___(fill in the blank)____

- What specific feature of your game will be implemented using this concept?


- Why does it make sense to implement this feature with this concept? Justify
  why this is a non-trivial application of the concept in question.
